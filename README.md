# angular-seed-sj

This is an easily modifiable angular-seed incorporating angular-ui, bootstrap, and currently jQuery.

## Dependencies
* [Node.JS] (http://nodejs.org/) - backend platform entirely in javascript
* [MongoDB] (http://www.mongodb.org/) - non-relational database

## Server Setup

After pulling, navigate to the main folder and open cmd prompt, enter and run:
* `npm install` -- this installs all needed dependencies
* `grunt` -- compiles all code into its production form, which is currently what the index file is looking at to run
* `node server` -- server.js is the file in which the node server is located, node server runs this server

In order to view the web page, go to localhost:1337 in a browser

## Directory Structure
This seed is setup to easily incorporate new files without having to often modify app.js or index.html.

### Front-end
All frontend code is located in `app/` 

`app/js` hosts all js files. To add new files, simply create a new file within any of the respective folders and it will be automatically compiled.  
 
####For example, to add a new directive:  

* Navigate to `app/js/directives`
* Create a new .js file named after your directive (`[directiveName].js`)
* In the file, declare a new directive
```js
angular.module("myApp.directives").directive("[directiveName]", function() { [directive functionality] });
```
* Add all third party minified dependency js files to `app/lib/third-party-js` and all third party less files to `app/less/third-party`
* Run `grunt` in command prompt and it's done! Use as normal.
* Follow the same steps for services and filters but replace all uses of `directives` with `services` or `filters`

####To add a new partial:
* Create a new html file in `app/partials`
* Open `app/js/app.js`
* Add routing to your new partial
		
		$routeProvider.when('/[partialName]', {templateUrl: 'partials/[partialName].html'});

* Navigate to `app/js/controllers`
* Create a new .js file named after the controller (`[controllerName].js`)
* In the file, declare a new controller
		
		angular.module('myApp.controllers').controller('[controllerName]', ['$scope', function($scope) { [controller functionality] });

* In the partial, set up ng-controller to use the controller you just created
		
		<div ng-controller = '[controllerName]'> 
			//html code
		</div>

* Run `grunt` to compile the controller
* Run `node server` in a command prompt
* Navigate to the site `localhost:1337/[partialName]` to see it

### Back-end
The site is hosted using Node.JS

#### Initial Installation and Setup
*This assumes that the user has Node.JS already installed.  If they don't, see the [Node Docs](http://nodejs.org/) for installation instructions*  

* The first time initializing the app, the user must run `npm install` to install all dependencies
* The package.json file in the root folder contains necessary dependencies for Node, as well as Grunt (the task-runner for building the app).  It also specifies the version of each dependency to install.  
	* Node dependencies:
		* [express](http://expressjs.com/) (node.js web framework)
		* [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/) (MongoDB database)
	* Grunt dependencies:
		* [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) (task-runner for javascript)
		* [jshint](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint) (checks all js files for errors, and will halt grunt if errors are found)
		* [uglify](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify) (minifies files)
		* [less](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-less) (converts all .less files to one .css files)
		* [karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/grunt-karma) (runs unit and e2e tests)
		* [concat](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-concat) (concatenates files)
* Any time a new module or dependency is added, `npm install` must be run again to install that new piece

#### Running the Server

* To start the server, open a command terminal, navigate to the root directory, and type `node server`
* The terminal should then say `Listening on port 1337`

#### Adding Routes for Backend API Calls

There are 2 main steps for adding a new route for a backend api call:  
* Add a line in the server.js file to route the specific call  

		// use express app.get to create a route
		app.get('/api/ex1', handlers.test1);

* Add handler logic in node/handlers.js file to generate the appropriate response

		/*
		   create function to handle request 
		   express feeds all request handlers a request and response object
		*/
		function test1(request, response) {
			// sent the text 'test1' as the response
			response.send('test1');
		}
		// include test1 as part of the exports so it's accessible in the server.js file
		exports.test1 = test1;

	Request handling can obviously become more complex when querying databases and such, but the routing principles remain the same.


#### Adding custom modules
